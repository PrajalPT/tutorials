* JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
* JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
* ECMAScript is a Standard for scripting languages such as JavaScript, JScript, etc. 
  The full form of ECMA is European Computer Manufacturer's Association.
  It is a trademark scripting language specification. JavaScript is a language based 
  on ECMAScript. 
* You don't have to get or download JavaScript.
* JavaScript is already running in your browser on your computer, on your tablet, and on 
  your smart-phone.
* JavaScript is free to use for everyone.
* JavaScript is a synchronus language means only one thread is executing the code.

1.Data types
	* Primitive values
		1.Boolean:- Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and 
		  false. 
		2.null:- The Null type has exactly one value: null
		3.Undefined:- A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined.
		4.Number:- The Number type is used to store floating and Interger values including 
		  +ve and -ve numbers.
		5.NaN(Not a Number):- NaN ("Not a Number") is typically encountered when the result 
		  of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number.
		6.String:- JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of 
		  "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values. Each element in the String occupies a 
		  position in the String. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, 
		  and so on.
				   
		Note:- When you declare a primitive data type in JavaScript, it is stored on a stack. 
		       A stack is a simple data structure that the computer uses to store and 
			   retrieve data quickly.
	* Non Primitive values
		1.Object/Array/Function:- Variables that are assigned a non-primitive value are given 
		  a reference to that value. That reference points to the object’s location in memory. 
		  The variables don’t actually contain the value. 
		
		Note:- Whenever a non-primitive data type is defined, it refers a memory location 
			   where the data is stored in heap memory i.e., it refers to the memory location
			   where an object is placed.

2.Variables
	* Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
	* The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
	* The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015(ES6).
	
	#Show image of difference between var vs let vs const#
	
	* Hoisting:- Variable can be used before it has been declared.
	* Shadowing:-
		function func() {
			var a = 'Geeks';//lexical scope
			let b = 'Geeks;
			 
			if (true) {
				var a = 'GeeksforGeeks'; // Shadowing
				console.log(a); // It will print 'GeeksforGeeks'
				console.log(b); // It will print error
			}
			console.log(a); // It will print 'GeeksforGeeks'
		}
		func();
